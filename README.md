# World Happiness Data Analysis

## Overview
This project involves analyzing the World Happiness Report data to understand the factors contributing to happiness scores across different countries. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization, all performed in a single Jupyter Notebook. The project also contains inital machine learning modeling which will be further explored and implemented.

## Project Motivation
In recent years, several countries have placed in the top ten happiest countries in the world. I wanted to further explore the criteria by which these countries' placements were determined by looking for commonalities, relationships, and outliers in the data. The project helped further develop my Python, data analysis, and SQL capabilities while also providing a unique opportunity to further explore my interest in international relations. 

## Features
- **Anaconda Virtual Environment**: The project was implemented in a Conda environment.
- **Python Libraries**: Several common python packages and libraries were implemented in this project. They include: pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
- **MySQL**: A remote connection to a MySQL server was established in order to perform a more targeted data analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Several charts were generated using matplotlib to provide a better understanding of the data.

## Technologies Used
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Programming Language**: Python, SQL
- **Environment**: Anaconda, Jupyter Notebooks

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kdiaz1452/Happiness_Reports.git
   cd Happiness_Reports
   ```
2. Set Up Virtual Environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv env
   source env\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Project Set Up:
   - Install the required packages.
   - Edit the code (if necessary) to include the appropriate file path.

## Learning Outcomes
I learned more about Python's use in data science and data analytics, data cleaning, the EDA process, and how to use the various Python libraries and packages in this project. I also became more comfortable using MySQL, SQL, and integrating remote connections. 

## Challenges
The biggest challenge was figuring out the trajectory of this project and planning on how to get to that point. Working with data spanning several years and multiple files, determining what relationships to look for, and beginning to implement the prediction model were all challenging as well. However, this project provided a real-world problem to analyze and offered plenty of opportunities to further develop my skills.
